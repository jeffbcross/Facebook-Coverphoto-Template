Facebook Cover Photo Template
=============================

Contained within is a single PSD, template.psd, with all the guides and helpers you need to prototype cool photos utilizing Facebook's timeline profiles. The PSD contains:
 * A flat example image for context
 * A group with placeholders for the cover photo, including an empty layer to add your photo. The empty layer is grouped with a container so your photo will automatically be bound to the area.
